	<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
	<p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

	<h2>Agreement</h2>
	<p>By accessing or using typeart.co, you agree to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the site.</p>

	<h2>Accounts</h2>
	<p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and for all activity that occurs under it. Use a strong, unique password. You must provide accurate information when creating an account. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.</p>

	<h2>Products & Pricing</h2>
	<p>All products are keyboard kits that require assembly — switches and keycaps are not included unless stated otherwise. Product prices are listed in USD and include free US shipping. Prices are subject to change without notice. We reserve the right to correct pricing errors and cancel affected orders with a full refund.</p>

	<h2>Orders & Payment</h2>
	<p>All orders are subject to product availability. Payment is processed securely through Stripe at the time of checkout. An order confirmation does not guarantee shipment — orders may be cancelled and refunded if stock is unavailable or if we detect fraudulent activity.</p>

	<h2>Shipping & Returns</h2>
	<p>We ship to US addresses only via USPS, UPS, or FedEx. All keyboard kit sales are final. For damaged or defective items, see our <a href="/shipping">Shipping & Returns</a> page.</p>

	<h2>Leaderboard</h2>
	<p>Typing test scores must be earned legitimately. Automated submissions, score manipulation, or exploiting bugs to gain unfair leaderboard positions may result in score removal and account suspension.</p>

	<h2>Keyboard Tools</h2>
	<p>The keymap editor, matrix tester, and firmware files are provided as-is without warranty. Modifying your keyboard firmware carries inherent risk. We are not responsible for damage to keyboards resulting from flashing firmware or keymaps.</p>

	<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
	<p>All content on this site — including logos, product photos, page designs, and software — is owned by TypeArt and may not be copied, reproduced, or distributed without permission. The open-source keyboard tools (QMK, VIA) retain their respective licenses.</p>

	<h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
	<p>Do not attempt to access other users' data, disrupt the service, scrape content, or exploit vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly to <a href="mailto:hello@typeart.co">hello@typeart.co</a>.</p>

	<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
	<p>TypeArt is provided on an "as is" basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the site, products, or tools. Our total liability for any claim shall not exceed the amount you paid for the applicable product or service.</p>

	<h2>Changes</h2>
	<p>We may update these terms from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top reflects the most recent revision. Continued use of the site after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
