	<h1>Shipping & Returns</h1>
	<p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

	<h2>Shipping</h2>
	<p>We ship to addresses within the United States. All orders include free standard shipping.</p>

	<h2>Carriers</h2>
	<p>Orders are shipped via USPS, UPS, or FedEx depending on package size and destination. We choose the carrier that provides the best delivery time for your area.</p>

	<h2>Delivery Time</h2>
	<p>Most orders ship within 1–3 business days of payment. Standard delivery takes 3–7 business days after shipment. Total time from order to delivery is typically 4–10 business days.</p>

	<h2>Order Tracking</h2>
	<p>Once your order ships, you'll receive an email with your tracking number and a link to track your package. You can also view tracking information on your <a href="/orders">order history</a> page.</p>

	<h2>Returns</h2>
	<p>All keyboard kit sales are final. Because our kits are specialty items assembled and packaged to order, we are unable to accept returns or exchanges.</p>

	<h2>Damaged or Defective Items</h2>
	<p>If your order arrives damaged or with defective components, contact us within 7 days of delivery at <a href="mailto:hello@typeart.co">hello@typeart.co</a> with your order number and photos of the issue. Once we receive and verify the returned item, we'll send a replacement at no cost. Return shipping for defective items is on us.</p>
